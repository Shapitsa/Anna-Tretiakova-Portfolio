    <p>The BUHHS Hackathon is a one-day event that happened on March 1st, 2025, dedicated to introducing high school students from underserved communities to the exciting world of STEM. Through hands-on coding, mentorship, and collaborative projects, students gained confidence and inspiration to pursue future opportunities in technology. </p>

    <p>As a retired athlete, I cannot emphasize enough how prizes, medals, and trophies are a vital part of any competition, serving as lifelong souvenirs and a source of inspiration for the recipients. It was my honor to design, build and then award the winners of the 2025 BUHHS. First, second and third placements each got a medal, while recipients of special award categories like Best Beginner, Best Technical, Best Presentation and Most Creative got trophies. The balloon towers were seven feet tall and created a festive atmosphere on stage for all the speeches and panels that happened during the event. </p>

    <p>Below you can see a close up of the Medals, Trophies and the Balloon Towers.</p>

    <p>These awards for the Boston University Hacks High School (BUHHS) was selected for funding by the Engineering Student Innovation Fund (ESIF)! A funding level of $300 was used to buy the supplies for medals, trophies and balloon towers, which were all built in the Singh Imagineering Lab (SiLab) and Bioengineering Technology & Entrepreneurship Center (BTEC).</p>
