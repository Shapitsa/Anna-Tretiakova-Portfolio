    <p>This project focused on designing a new commercial aircraft to serve the underserved 200–250 passenger market segment. The goal was to bridge the gap between large wide-body aircraft and smaller narrow-body jets by delivering a 4,000–5,000 nautical mile range while maintaining a projected profit margin of 5–10%. Our objective was to combine the spacious comfort of wide-body aircraft with the operational efficiency of narrow-body designs, creating a midsize airliner optimized for both passenger experience and airline economics.I developed the full CAD model of the aircraft, designing the fuselage, wing geometry, and overall configuration to meet range and capacity targets. Our team used Excel to perform performance calculations, including range estimates, weight analysis, and preliminary economic evaluations to support the design decisions. In addition to the technical design, I created the airline brand identity, Vel-Air, a name inspired by velocity and air, reflecting the aircraft’s performance-driven philosophy. I designed the airline logo and developed flight attendant uniform concepts, integrating aesthetics with the aircraft’s modern, streamlined identity. This project allowed me to combine aerospace engineering design with branding and visual identity, demonstrating both technical modeling skills and creative systems thinking.</p>
