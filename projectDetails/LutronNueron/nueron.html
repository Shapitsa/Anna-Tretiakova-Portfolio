    <h1>My Last Two Brain Cells - Submission for the 2025 Lutron Competition</h1>
    <p>During the month of February, my team and I prepared a project for a lighting competition organized by Lutron Electronics and Singh Imagineering Laboratory (SiLab) at Boston University College of Engineering. The project prompt was very open ended: “Have fun and make the light shine with your imagination!” </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>My team’s project called “My Last Two Brain Cells” created a realistic demonstration of how neurons fire and communicate with a simple sound to light circuit. I designed and built this circuit using only a transistor, two resistors, an LED, a microphone, and a 12-volt battery. As music plays, the microphone picks up vibrations, triggering the transistor to amplify current to the LED lights. This creates a dynamic, synchronized flashing effect that pulses perfectly in time with the music. Our project also featured a walkie-talkie element, allowing the music detected by one neuron to be transmitted to another. This enabled the second neuron to light up in perfect sync with the music, even from a distance. </p>

    <p>My team placed third overall! I would like to thank my team Julie Bui and Henry Corrigan for their hard work and commitment to the project.  </p>

    <p>On a different note, as a lab advisor at SiLab, I had the opportunity to make the medals for this competition a second year in a row and it was a full circle moment for me to win a medal I made myself. These medals glow in the dark, which perfectly aligns with the motivations behind the Lutron Competition.</p>
